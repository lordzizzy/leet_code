# Super Palindromes
# Let's say a positive integer is a super-palindrome if it is a palindrome, and
# it is also the square of a palindrome.

# Given two positive integers left and right represented as strings, return the
# number of super-palindromes integers in the inclusive range [left, right].

# Example 1:
# Input: left = "4", right = "1000"
# Output: 4
# Explanation: 4, 9, 121, and 484 are superpalindromes.
# Note that 676 is not a superpalindrome: 26 * 26 = 676, but 26 is not a
# palindrome.

# Example 2:
# Input: left = "1", right = "2"
# Output: 1

# Constraints:
# 1 <= left.length, right.length <= 18
# left and right consist of only digits.
# left and right cannot have leading zeros.
# left and right represent integers in the range [1, 10ยนโธ].
# left is less than or equal to right.
