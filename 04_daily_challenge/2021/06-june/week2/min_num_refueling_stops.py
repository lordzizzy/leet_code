# Minimum Number of Refueling Stops
# A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is target miles
# east of the starting position.

# Along the way, there are gas stations.  Each station[i] represents a gas
# station that is station[i][0] miles east of the starting position, and has
# station[i][1] liters of gas.

# The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has startFuel
# liters of fuel in it.  It uses 1 liter of gas per 1 mile that it drives.

# When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all
# the gas from the station into the car.

# What is the least number of refueling stops the car must make in order to
# reach its destination?  If it cannot reach the destination, return -1.

# Note that if the car reaches a gas station with 0 fuel left, the car can
# still refuel there.  If the car reaches the destination with 0 fuel left, it
# is still considered to have arrived.

# Example 1:
# Input: target = 1, startFuel = 1, stations = []
# Output: 0
# Explanation: We can reach the target without refueling.

# Example 2:
# Input: target = 100, startFuel = 1, stations = [[10,100]]
# Output: -1
# Explanation: We can't reach the target (or even the first gas station).

# Example 3:
# Input: target = 100, startFuel = 10, stations =
# [[10,60],[20,30],[30,30],[60,40]]
# Output: 2
# Explanation:
# We start with 10 liters of fuel.
# We drive to position 10, expending 10 liters of fuel.  We refuel from 0
# liters to 60 liters of gas.

# Then, we drive from position 10 to position 60 (expending 50 liters of fuel),
# and refuel from 10 liters to 50 liters of gas.  We then drive to and reach
# the target.

# We made 2 refueling stops along the way, so we return 2.

# Note:
# 1 <= target, startFuel, stations[i][1] <= 10^9
# 0 <= stations.length <= 500
# 0 < stations[0][0] < stations[1][0] < ... < stations[stations.length-1][0] <
# target
